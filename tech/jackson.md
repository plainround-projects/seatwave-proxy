# Jackson 2.23.0 (JSON in and out)

## What it is

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text format for data. An **object** is a set of named values between braces, `{"eventId":1,"seat":"A-1"}`. A name is a **field**. A value is a number, a piece of text in double quotes, `true`, `false`, `null`, another object, or a list in square brackets. Programs on different machines and in different languages all read it, which is why web services use it.

**Jackson** is the Java library that turns JSON text into Java values and back. Reading JSON into a Java value is called **binding** or **deserializing**. Writing a Java value as JSON is **serializing**. Jackson is made of three parts, each one a jar:

| Jar | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `jackson-core` | The low-level reader and writer of JSON text, one token at a time (`JsonParser`, `JsonToken`). |
| `jackson-annotations` | Labels such as `@JsonProperty` that a class can carry. This repository uses none, but `jackson-databind` needs the jar. |
| `jackson-databind` | The part that binds JSON to Java classes and records. Its main class is `ObjectMapper`. |

The repository asks only for `jackson-databind`; Gradle brings the other two (`dependency-locking.md`). All three are version 2.23.0, except the annotations jar, which is `2.23` (Jackson publishes it with no patch number).

## Why this repository uses it

SeatWave's version 1 API (Module 7) takes a JSON body to hold a seat and answers in JSON. The backend runs on the JDK's own HTTP server, which has no JSON support, so a library is needed. The module's concern is a proxy in front of the backend, and the proxy passes request bodies through. If the backend accepted a body loosely, a typo, a wrong type or a field the contract does not list could pass unnoticed, and a proxy test could not tell whether the proxy or the backend changed the request. So `JsonCodec` is strict: a body either matches a record exactly, or it is refused with a reason that names the field.

## Where it appears

| Path | What it does with Jackson |
| --- | --- |
| `gradle/libs.versions.toml` | `jackson = "2.23.0"`, the `jackson-bom` and `jackson-databind` entries (`toml-version-catalog.md`). |
| `build.gradle.kts` | `implementation(platform(libs.jackson.bom))` and `implementation(libs.jackson.databind)` (`gradle.md`). |
| `gradle.lockfile` | Locks the four Jackson lines on all four classpaths (`dependency-locking.md`). |
| `src/main/java/.../json/JsonCodec.java` | The only class that imports Jackson: it builds the `ObjectMapper`, binds a body (`read`) and writes a value (`write`). |
| `src/main/java/.../backend/SeatWaveRoutes.java`, `Problems.java` | Call `json.read` and `json.write`; they never import Jackson (`java-config-json-tls-walkthrough.md`). |

I searched `src` for `com.fasterxml`: only `JsonCodec.java` imports it, with 16 import lines. No test imports Jackson. The tests reach it through `JsonCodec` and through the HTTP answers of the backend.

## How it works underneath

1. `JsonMapper.builder()...build()` makes an `ObjectMapper`, the object that holds the settings. Making one is costly, so the codec makes exactly one, when the codec is created, and only reads it afterwards. Jackson documents a configured `ObjectMapper` as safe for many threads at once, which the class comment of `JsonCodec` relies on.
2. To read, the mapper asks a `JsonParser` for tokens (`START_OBJECT`, a field name, a number, `END_OBJECT`). It looks at the target type, here a Java **record**, finds the record's constructor, and calls it with the values it read. A record needs no annotations: its component names are the field names.
3. To write, the mapper looks at a record or a list or a map, and writes its components in the order the record declares them. `Problems.ProblemBody` says so in a comment: "record components are written in this order".
4. Everything is in memory. Jackson makes no network call and reads no file.
5. Every failure is an exception. The codec catches the ones a client can cause and turns each into a `Result.error` (`result4j.md`). The base class of all of them is `JacksonException`; `JsonMappingException` is the one for "the JSON is fine but does not fit the type", `MismatchedInputException` is a wrong type, and `UnrecognizedPropertyException` is a field the type does not have.

**What Jackson does by default.** A default `ObjectMapper` is forgiving. I ran a tiny program with the 2.23.0 jars. A record `Hold(long eventId, String seat)` was written as `{"eventId":1,"seat":"A-1"}` and read back as `Hold[eventId=7, seat=B-2]`. The text `"7"` in place of the number 7 was **coerced** (silently converted) to 7. A field `typo` that the record does not have raised `UnrecognizedPropertyException`, because refusing unknown fields is on by default. And `"eventId":null` for the primitive `long` was read as `0`, with no error, until `FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES` was switched on, which made it raise `MismatchedInputException`. Those are exactly the soft spots that `JsonCodec` closes.

## Walkthrough of this repository's use

### The imports

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JacksonException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonToken;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.StreamReadFeature;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.exc.InputCoercionException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.exc.StreamReadException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationFeature;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.MapperFeature;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.cfg.CoercionAction;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.cfg.CoercionInputShape;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.json.JsonMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.type.LogicalType;
import com.github.sviperll.result4j.Result;
import java.io.IOException;
```

- The first group (`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.*`) is `jackson-core`: `JacksonException` (the base of every Jackson failure), `JsonParser` and `JsonToken` (reading token by token), `JsonProcessingException` (thrown when writing fails), `StreamReadFeature` (switches of the parser), and `InputCoercionException` (a number that does not fit its type).
- The second group (`com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.*`) is `jackson-databind`: `DeserializationFeature` and `MapperFeature` (switches of the mapper), `JsonMappingException`, `MismatchedInputException` and `UnrecognizedPropertyException` (the exception family), `ObjectMapper` and `JsonMapper` (the mapper and its builder), and `CoercionAction`, `CoercionInputShape` and `LogicalType` (the vocabulary of the coercion rules).

### The strict mapper

```java
  private final ObjectMapper mapper =
      JsonMapper.builder()
          // A field the contract does not list is an error (additionalProperties: false), never
          // ignored: ignoring it would let a typo pass silently, and is how mass assignment starts.
          .enable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES)
          .enable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES)
          // "1" and 1.5 are not the integer the contract asks for: no silent conversion.
          .disable(MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS)
          .disable(DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_FLOAT_AS_INT)
          // The switch above covers numbers and booleans only; 5 or true is not a string either.
          .withCoercionConfig(
              LogicalType.Textual,
              textual ->
                  textual
                      .setCoercion(CoercionInputShape.Integer, CoercionAction.Fail)
                      .setCoercion(CoercionInputShape.Float, CoercionAction.Fail)
                      .setCoercion(CoercionInputShape.Boolean, CoercionAction.Fail))
          .enable(StreamReadFeature.STRICT_DUPLICATE_DETECTION)
          .build();
```

- `private final ObjectMapper mapper = JsonMapper.builder() ... .build();` makes the one mapper, as a field of the codec. `final` means it is assigned once. A **builder** collects settings and then builds an object that cannot be changed.
- `.enable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES)` refuses a field that the record does not list. The comment explains why even though it is on by default: "ignoring it would let a typo pass silently, and is how mass assignment starts." **Mass assignment** is an attack in which a client sends extra fields (such as `"admin":true`) and a loose binder stores them. Writing the line down also protects against a future default change.
- `.enable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES)` refuses `null` where the record has a primitive number. I showed above that without it `null` becomes `0` silently.
- `.disable(MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS)` refuses `"1"` where a number is wanted. A **scalar** is a single value (a number, a text, a boolean). The comment says `"1" and 1.5 are not the integer the contract asks for: no silent conversion.`
- `.disable(DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_FLOAT_AS_INT)` refuses `1.5` where an integer is wanted instead of cutting it to `1`.
- `.withCoercionConfig(LogicalType.Textual, textual -> textual.setCoercion(CoercionInputShape.Integer, CoercionAction.Fail)...)` is the reverse direction. A **lambda** is a short anonymous function: `textual -> ...` takes the settings object for text fields and changes it. For a field that expects **text**, an integer, a float and a boolean are each set to `CoercionAction.Fail`. The comment says: "The switch above covers numbers and booleans only; 5 or true is not a string either." So `{"seat": 5}` is refused.
- `.enable(StreamReadFeature.STRICT_DUPLICATE_DETECTION)` makes the parser refuse an object with the same field twice. By default the last one wins, which lets a client hide a value from a check that reads the first. I tested it: `{"eventId":1,"eventId":2,...}` was refused with "the body is not valid JSON".

### `read`: one success, eight refusals

```java
  public <T> Result<T, BindingProblem> read(String json, Class<T> type) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(json, "json");
    Objects.requireNonNull(type, "type");
    // The parser is driven by hand, so an empty body, a body that is not an object and data after
    // the object each get their own message instead of one generic type error.
    try (JsonParser parser = mapper.createParser(json)) {
      JsonToken first = parser.nextToken();
      if (first == null) {
        return Result.error(
            new BindingProblem(WHOLE_BODY, "the body is empty; send a JSON object"));
      }
      if (first != JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {
        return Result.error(new BindingProblem(WHOLE_BODY, "the body must be a JSON object"));
      }
      T value = mapper.readValue(parser, type);
      return hasMore(parser)
          ? Result.error(new BindingProblem(WHOLE_BODY, "the body has data after the JSON object"))
          : Result.success(value);
    } catch (UnrecognizedPropertyException unknownField) {
      return Result.error(
          new BindingProblem(
              "/" + escaped(unknownField.getPropertyName()), "is not a field of this request"));
    } catch (MismatchedInputException wrongType) {
      return Result.error(new BindingProblem(pointerOf(wrongType), "has the wrong type"));
    } catch (JsonMappingException unbound) {
      // 99999999999999999999 is valid JSON; it only does not fit the field's type.
      if (unbound.getCause() instanceof InputCoercionException) {
        return Result.error(
            new BindingProblem(pointerOf(unbound), "is out of range for this field"));
      }
      return Result.error(new BindingProblem(WHOLE_BODY, "the body is not valid JSON"));
    } catch (StreamReadException malformed) {
      if (malformed.getOriginalMessage().startsWith(DUPLICATE_MESSAGE)
          && malformed.getProcessor() != null) {
        // The parser stopped on the repeated name, so its context is the path of that field.
        String pointer = malformed.getProcessor().getParsingContext().pathAsPointer().toString();
        return Result.error(new BindingProblem(pointer, "appears more than once"));
      }
      return Result.error(new BindingProblem(WHOLE_BODY, "the body is not valid JSON"));
    } catch (JacksonException malformed) {
      return Result.error(new BindingProblem(WHOLE_BODY, "the body is not valid JSON"));
    } catch (IOException notReadable) {
      // Every parse failure is a JacksonException; reading from a string has no other I/O to fail.
      throw new UncheckedIOException("reading a string failed", notReadable);
    }
  }
```

- `public <T> Result<T, BindingProblem> read(String json, Class<T> type)` is **generic**: `<T>` stands for any record type the caller names with `type`. It returns a `Result` (`result4j.md`): the record, or a `BindingProblem` with a `pointer` and a `detail`.
- `Objects.requireNonNull(...)` twice refuse a `null` argument. That is a programming error, so it throws.
- The comment says the parser is driven by hand: "an empty body, a body that is not an object and data after the object each get their own message instead of one generic type error." `try (JsonParser parser = mapper.createParser(json))` opens a parser on the text; the **try-with-resources** closes it at the end.
- `JsonToken first = parser.nextToken();` reads the first token. `null` means the text was empty. Anything but `START_OBJECT` means the body is not an object, for example `[1]`.
- `T value = mapper.readValue(parser, type);` binds the object to the record. The next line asks `hasMore(parser)` (below) whether anything follows the closing brace.
- The `catch` blocks go from the most specific exception to the most general, because Java takes the first block that fits. `UnrecognizedPropertyException` becomes the pointer `"/" + escaped(unknownField.getPropertyName())` with "is not a field of this request". `MismatchedInputException` becomes "has the wrong type". Another `JsonMappingException` is checked for a cause of `InputCoercionException`, the comment's example being `99999999999999999999`, "valid JSON; it only does not fit the field's type", and becomes "is out of range for this field". A `StreamReadException` is a failure while reading the text; if its message starts with `Duplicate field '` (the switch `STRICT_DUPLICATE_DETECTION` reports a repeated field this way), the parser's position names the field, as the pointer `/eventId`, with "appears more than once". Any other `JacksonException` becomes "the body is not valid JSON". The `IOException` block is for a failure that cannot happen when reading a `String`, and so it throws.

I sent eight bad bodies to a running SeatWave (`POST /v1/holds`) of the first version, and the changed ones again to a SeatWave of version 1.0.1, and read the `detail` of each answer. Two answers changed in 1.0.1; the table shows both:

| Body | `detail` in the answer |
| --- | --- |
| (empty) | `the body is empty; send a JSON object` |
| `[1]` | `the body must be a JSON object` |
| `{"eventId":1,"seat":"A-3","customer":"Sam"} x` | 1.0.0: `the body is not valid JSON`; 1.0.1: `the body has data after the JSON object` |
| `{"eventId":"1","seat":"A-3","customer":"Sam"}` | `/eventId has the wrong type` |
| `{"eventId":99999999999999999999,...}` | `/eventId is out of range for this field` |
| `{"eventId":1,"seat":"A-3",` | `the body is not valid JSON` |
| `{"eventId":1,"eventId":2,...}` | 1.0.0: `the body is not valid JSON`; 1.0.1: `/eventId appears more than once` |
| `{"eventId":null,...}` | `/eventId must be 1 or more` |

`JsonCodecTest` checks the two 1.0.1 answers with the same shapes of body. The first: a stray `x` after the object is not a valid token, so Jackson raises a syntax error while looking for more data; `hasMore` treats that error as "there is more", because any text after the object is the problem. The second: the repeated field is found while reading, and the codec reads the field's name from the parser. The last row binds, because the record uses `Long`, a type that may be `null`; the route then refuses it with its own rule.

### `write` and the pointer helpers

```java
  /**
   * Writes a value as JSON.
   *
   * @param value a record, a list or a map of them
   * @return the JSON text
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the value cannot be written, which is a programming error
   */
  public String write(Object value) {
    try {
      return mapper.writeValueAsString(value);
    } catch (JsonProcessingException notWritable) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("not writable as JSON", notWritable);
    }
  }

  private static boolean hasMore(JsonParser parser) throws IOException {
    try {
      return parser.nextToken() != null;
    } catch (JacksonException notJson) {
      // Text after the object that is not JSON at all ("{...} x") is still data after the object,
      // and that is the reason the client needs, not "not valid JSON".
      return true;
    }
  }

  private static String pointerOf(JsonMappingException failure) {
    // RFC 6901 pointer: "/field" for each step of the path Jackson was reading.
    return failure.getPath().stream()
        .map(step ->
            step.getFieldName() == null
                ? String.valueOf(step.getIndex())
                : escaped(step.getFieldName()))
        .collect(Collectors.joining("/", "/", ""));
  }

  private static String escaped(String fieldName) {
    // RFC 6901: "~" and "/" inside a name are written "~0" and "~1", in this order.
    return fieldName.replace("~", "~0").replace("/", "~1");
  }
```

- `write` calls `mapper.writeValueAsString(value)`. Writing can fail only if the value cannot be written, which is a bug, so the `JsonProcessingException` is turned into an `IllegalArgumentException`.
- `pointerOf` builds a **JSON pointer** (RFC 6901), a path such as `/eventId` that names one place in a JSON document. Jackson's exception carries the path it was reading; `getPath().stream().map(...).collect(Collectors.joining("/", "/", ""))` writes each step (a field name, or a list index) and joins them with `/` after a leading `/`. A stream is a pipeline of steps over a list; `joining` glues the strings with a separator, a prefix and a suffix.
- `hasMore` reads one more token. `null` means nothing follows; a token means more JSON follows; a `JacksonException` means text that is not JSON follows. Only the first case is "no more", so the `catch` returns `true`.
- `escaped` writes a `~` as `~0` and a `/` as `~1`, in that order, as RFC 6901 requires, so a field name that contains a slash cannot be mistaken for two steps.

```java
  /**
   * Why a body did not bind.
   *
   * @param pointer the JSON pointer of the field at fault, or an empty string for the whole body
   * @param detail what is wrong, in words a client developer can act on
   */
  public record BindingProblem(String pointer, String detail) {

    /** Checks the fields. */
    public BindingProblem {
      Objects.requireNonNull(pointer, "pointer");
      Objects.requireNonNull(detail, "detail");
    }
  }
}
```

`BindingProblem` is a **record** (`java.md`) with two text components. Its compact constructor refuses `null`.

## Try it yourself

All commands ran in a scratch copy on 11 November 2026.

1. See who imports Jackson:

```
grep -rl "com.fasterxml" src
```

   Expected: `src/main/java/io/plainround/seatwave/proxy/json/JsonCodec.java` and nothing else.

2. See the jars Gradle chose:

```
./gradlew --offline -q dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath | grep jackson | head -8
```

   Expected: the BOM `com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom:2.23.0`, then `jackson-databind -> 2.23.0` with `jackson-annotations:2.23` and `jackson-core:2.23.0` below it.

3. Run the default mapper and see what it forgives. Save this as `J.java` in an empty folder:

```
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationFeature;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.json.JsonMapper;

public class J {
  record Hold(long eventId, String seat) {}

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    ObjectMapper lenient = JsonMapper.builder().build();
    ObjectMapper strict =
        JsonMapper.builder().enable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES).build();

    System.out.println(lenient.writeValueAsString(new Hold(1, "A-1")));
    Hold read = lenient.readValue("{\"eventId\":7,\"seat\":\"B-2\"}", Hold.class);
    System.out.println(read);
    System.out.println(lenient.readValue("{\"eventId\":\"7\",\"seat\":\"B-2\"}", Hold.class));
    try {
      lenient.readValue("{\"eventId\":7,\"seat\":\"B-2\",\"typo\":1}", Hold.class);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e.getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
    try {
      strict.readValue("{\"eventId\":null,\"seat\":\"B-2\"}", Hold.class);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e.getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
    System.out.println(lenient.readValue("{\"eventId\":null,\"seat\":\"B-2\"}", Hold.class));
  }
}
```

   Run it with the three jars from Gradle's cache on the class path:

```
CP=$(find ~/.gradle -name 'jackson-databind-2.23.0.jar'|head -1):$(find ~/.gradle -name 'jackson-core-2.23.0.jar'|head -1):$(find ~/.gradle -name 'jackson-annotations-2.23.jar'|head -1)
java -cp "$CP" J.java
```

   Expected, six lines: `{"eventId":1,"seat":"A-1"}`, `Hold[eventId=7, seat=B-2]`, `Hold[eventId=7, seat=B-2]`, `UnrecognizedPropertyException`, `MismatchedInputException` and `Hold[eventId=0, seat=B-2]`.

4. Send a bad body to the real codec. Start SeatWave on ports the system picks (copy `config/backend-local.properties`, set the three ports to `0`, run `./gradlew --offline -q serve --args='<your copy>'`), then:

```
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:<plain port>/v1/holds -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Idempotency-Key: "k-0002"' -d '{"eventId":1,"seat":"A-2","bogus":1}'
```

   Expected: a JSON problem document with `"status":400` and `"detail":"/bogus is not a field of this request"`. Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

5. Look at the success answer of a hold with the same server: the same command with `-d '{"eventId":1,"seat":"A-1","customer":"Sam"}'` and `-i` shows `HTTP/1.1 201 Created`, a `Location: /v1/holds/<id>` header and the body `{"holdId":"<id>","eventId":1,"seat":"A-1","state":"held","expiresAt":"<time>"}`: that body is `json.write` of a record, with its components in declaration order.

## Mistakes people make

- **Keeping Jackson's defaults for an API that must be strict.** They convert `"7"` to 7 and `null` to 0 without a word.
- **Making a new `ObjectMapper` for every request.** It is costly. One mapper, configured once, is the documented safe pattern.
- **Ignoring unknown fields to be "tolerant".** A typo then passes, and extra fields reach the code. This repository refuses them.
- **Letting Jackson exceptions reach the client.** Their messages can quote the input and the internal class names. The codec maps each one to a short, safe sentence.
- **Trusting the number of tokens.** An object followed by more data is a different failure from an object with a typo; the code looks for it on purpose.
- **Using a mutable class for a request.** A record cannot change after it is built, so a checked request stays checked.

## Check yourself

1. *What are the three Jackson jars, and which one does the build file name?* `jackson-core`, `jackson-annotations` and `jackson-databind`; only `jackson-databind`, and Gradle brings the others.
2. *Why is `FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES` switched on?* Without it a `null` for a primitive number becomes `0` silently.
3. *What does `STRICT_DUPLICATE_DETECTION` stop?* An object that names the same field twice, where the last value would otherwise win.
4. *What is a JSON pointer?* A path such as `/eventId` that names one place in a document; the codec uses it to name the field at fault.
5. *Why does `read` return a `Result` and not throw?* A client can cause every one of these failures, so each is a value the caller must handle; only a bug is an exception.
